    PP-Module for File Encryption is
    to describe the security functionality of 
    File Encryption
    products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <ul><li>Application Software, version 2.0.</li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>File Encryption, Version 2.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activities to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

              This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g. by derivation 
              from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how they are overwritten.<br/><br/>

              The evaluator shall check to ensure the KMD lists each type of key that is stored in non-volatile memory, and 
              identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store, retrieve, destroy). 
              The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the platform, including an identification 
              and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g., file system APIs, platform key store APIs).<br/><br/>

              The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the 
              interface supports the selection(s) and description in the KMD.<br/><br/>

              If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator 
              examines the KMD to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall 
              verify that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.<br/><br/>

              The evaluator shall check that the KMD identifies any configurations or 
              circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement.<br/><br/>

              If the selection "destruction of all KEKs protecting target key, 
              where none of the KEKs protecting the target key are derived" is included the evaluator shall examine the TOE's 
              keychain in the KMD and identify each instance when a key is destroyed by this method. In each instance the evaluator 
              shall verify all keys capable of decrypting the target key are destroyed in accordance with a specified key destruction 
              method in FCS_CKM.6.2. The evaluator shall verify that all of the keys capable of decrypting the target key are not 
              able to be derived to reestablish the keychain after their destruction. <br/><br/>
		      
                The evaluator shall verify the KMD includes a description of the areas where keys and
                key material reside and when the keys and key material are no longer needed.<br/><br/>
                
                The evaluator shall verify the KMD includes a key lifecycle, that includes a description
                where key material reside, how the key material is used, how it is determined that keys
                and key material are no longer needed, and how the material is destroyed once it is not
                needed and that the documentation in the KMD follows FCS_CKM.6.2 for the
                destruction.<br/><br/>


              </div></div><div class="eacategory">Guidance</div><div class="ea"><div class="ea">There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases.<br/><br/>

              The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may 
              not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the 
              relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>

              The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key 
              destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.<br/><br/>

Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here. <br/><br/>

              When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing 
              wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible 
              but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements 
              garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.<br/><br/>

              Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time 
              until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time 
              if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and 
              file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection 
              upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is 
              connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.<br/><br/>

              The drive should be healthy and contain minimal corrupted data and should be at
              end-of-life before a significant 
              amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of 
              potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.<br/><br/>

                selected conditioning function. These activities are separately addressed in the text
                below.

                <p>
                  The evaluator will test the authenticated encryption functionality of AES-KW for EACH
                  combination of the following input parameter lengths:
                  <ul>
                    <li>128 and 256 bit key encryption keys (KEKs)</li>
                    <li>Three plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be two semi-blocks (128
                      bits). One of the plaintext lengths shall be three semi-blocks (192 bits). The third data
                      unit length shall be the longest supported plaintext length less than or equal to 64
                      semi-blocks (4096 bits).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  using a set of 100 key and plaintext pairs and obtain the ciphertext that results from AES-KW
                  authenticated encryption. To determine correctness, the evaluator will use the AES-KW
                  authenticated-encryption function of a known good implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  
                  The evaluator will test the authenticated-decryption functionality of AES-KW using the
                  same test as for authenticated-encryption, replacing plaintext values with ciphertext values
                  and AES-KW authenticated-encryption with AES-KW authenticated-decryption.

                  The evaluator will test the authenticated-encryption functionality of AES-KWP using the
                  same test as for AES-KW authenticated-encryption with the following change in the three
                  plaintext lengths:

                <br/><br/>AES-CCM Tests
                
                <br/><br/>It is not recommended that evaluators use values obtained from static sources such as 
                http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/mac/ccmtestvectors.zip
                or use values not generated expressly to exercise the AES-CCM implementation.
                
                <br/><br/>The evaluator shall test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification
                functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths:
                Keys: All supported and selected key sizes (e.g., 128, 256 bits).
                Associated Data: Two or three values for associated data length: The minimum (≥ 0 bytes) and maximum (≤ 32 bytes) supported associated data lengths, and 2^16 (65536) bytes, if supported.
                Payload: Two values for payload length: The minimum (≥ 0 bytes) and maximum (≤ 32 bytes) supported payload lengths.
                Nonces: All supported nonce lengths (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) in bytes.
                Tag: All supported tag lengths (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16) in bytes.
                
                <br/><br/>The testing for CCM consists of five tests. To determine correctness in each of the below tests, the evaluator shall compare the ciphertext with the result of encryption of the same inputs with a known good implementation.
                
                <br/><br/>Variable Associated Data Test
                <br/>For each supported key size and associated data length, and any supported payload length, nonce length, and tag length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                
                <br/><br/>Variable Payload Text
                <br/>For each supported key size and payload length, and any supported associated data length, nonce length, and tag length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                
                <br/><br/>Variable Nonce Test
                <br/>For each supported key size and nonce length, and any supported associated data length, payload length, and tag length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                
                <br/><br/>Variable Tag Test
                <br/>For each supported key size and tag length, and any supported associated data length, payload length, and nonce length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                
                <br/><br/>Decryption-Verification Process Test
                <br/>To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for each combination of supported associated data length, payload length, nonce length, and tag length, the evaluator shall supply a key value and 15 sets of input plus ciphertext, and obtain the decrypted payload. Ten of the 15 input sets supplied should fail verification and five should pass.
