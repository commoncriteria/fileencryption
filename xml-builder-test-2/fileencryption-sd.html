    PP-Module for File Encryption Enterprise Management is
    to describe the security functionality of 
    File Encryption Enterprise Management
    products in terms of 
    [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for them.

    
    The PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
        <ul><li>Application Software, version 2.0.</li></ul><br/>
    This SD is mandatory for evaluations of TOEs that claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the PP-Module for :
    <ul><li>File Encryption Enterprise Management, Version 2.0</li></ul>
    As such it defines Evaluation Activities for the functionality described in the PP-Module as well as any impacts to the Evaluation Activities to the Base-PP(s) it modifies.
    </p><p> 
Although Evaluation Activities are defined mainly for the evaluators to follow, in general they also help developers to prepare for evaluation by identifying specific requirements for their TOE.
    The specific requirements in Evaluation Activities may in some cases clarify the meaning of Security
    Functional Requirements (SFR), and may identify particular requirements for the content of Security
    Targets (ST) (especially the TOE Summary Specification), user guidance documentation, and possibly
    supplementary information (e.g. for entropy analysis or cryptographic key management architecture).</p><h2 id="structure" class="indexable" data-level="1">1.2 Structure of the Document</h2><p>Evaluation Activities can be defined for both SFRs and Security Assurance Requirements (SAR),
    which are themselves defined in separate sections of the SD.</p><p>If any Evaluation Activity cannot be successfully completed in an evaluation, then
    the overall verdict for the evaluation is a 'fail'.
    In rare cases there may be acceptable reasons why an Evaluation Activity
    may be modified or deemed not applicable for a particular TOE, 
    but this must be approved by the Certification Body for the evaluation.</p><p>In general, if all Evaluation Activities (for both SFRs and SARs) are successfully
    completed in an evaluation then it would be expected that the overall verdict for 
    the evaluation is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict when the Evaluation Activities have been successfully 
    completed would require a specific justification from the evaluator as to why the 
    Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.
    </p><p>Similarly, at the more granular level of assurance components, if the Evaluation 
    Activities for an assurance component and all of its related SFR Evaluation 
    Activities are successfully completed in an evaluation then it would be expected 
    that the verdict for the assurance component is a ‘pass’.
    To reach a ‘fail’ verdict for the assurance component when these Evaluation 
    Activities have been successfully completed would require a specific justification 
    from the evaluator as to why the Evaluation Activities were not sufficient for that TOE.

</table></div><h1 id="sfr" class="indexable" data-level="0">2 Evaluation Activities for SFRs</h1><p>The EAs presented in this section capture the actions the evaluator performs 
    to address technology specific aspects covering specific SARs (e.g. ASE_TSS.1, 
    ADV_FSP.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1) – this is in addition to the CEM workunits 
    that are performed in Section <a href="#sar_aas" class="dynref">3 Evaluation Activities for SARs</a>.</p><p>Regarding design descriptions (designated by the subsections labeled TSS, as 
    well as any required supplementary material that may be treated as proprietary), 
    the evaluator must ensure there is specific information that satisfies the EA. 
    For findings regarding the TSS section, the evaluator’s verdicts will be 
    associated with the CEM workunit ASE_TSS.1-1.
    Evaluator verdicts associated with the supplementary evidence will also be 
    associated with ASE_TSS.1-1, 
    since the requirement to provide such evidence is specified in ASE in the PP.</p><p>For ensuring the guidance documentation provides sufficient information for 
    the administrators/users as it pertains to SFRs, the evaluator’s verdicts will 
    be associated with CEM workunits ADV_FSP.1-7, AGD_OPE.1-4, and AGD_OPE.1-5.</p><p>Finally, the subsection labeled Tests is where the authors have determined 
    that testing of the product in the context of the associated SFR is necessary.
    While the evaluator is expected to develop tests, there may be instances where 
    it is more practical for the developer to construct tests, or where the 
    developer may have existing tests.

                The evaluator shall verify the TSS provides a high level description of what it means
                for keys and key material to be no longer needed and when then should be expected to
                be destroyed. <h4>KMD</h4>   
                The evaluator examines the KMD to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory. 
                This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g. by derivation 
                from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how they are overwritten.
                
                The evaluator shall check to ensure the KMD lists each type of key that is stored in in non-volatile memory, and 
                identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store, retrieve, destroy). 
                The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the platform, including an identification 
                and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g., file system APIs, platform key store APIs).
                
                The evaluator examines the interface description for each different media type to ensure that the 
                interface supports the selection(s) and description in the KMD.
                
                If the ST makes use of the open assignment and fills in the type of pattern that is used, the evaluator 
                examines the KMD to ensure it describes how that pattern is obtained and used. The evaluator shall 
                verify that the pattern does not contain any CSPs.
                
                The evaluator shall check that the KMD identifies any configurations or 
                circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement.
                
                If the selection "destruction of all KEKs protecting target key, 
                where none of the KEKs protecting the target key are derived" is included the evaluator shall examine the TOE's 
                keychain in the KMD and identify each instance when a key is destroyed by this method. In each instance the evaluator 
                shall verify all keys capable of decrypting the target key are destroyed in accordance with a specified key destruction 
                method in FCS_CKM.6.2. The evaluator shall verify that all of the keys capable of decrypting the target key are not 
                able to be derived to reestablish the keychain after their destruction. 
                
                The evaluator shall verify the KMD includes a description of the areas where keys and
                key material reside and when the keys and key material are no longer needed.
                
                The evaluator shall verify the KMD includes a key lifecycle, that includes a description
                where key material reside, how the key material is used, how it is determined that keys
                and key material are no longer needed, and how the material is destroyed once it is not
                needed and that the documentation in the KMD follows FCS_CKM.6.2 for the
                destruction.</div></div><div class="eacategory">Guidance</div><div class="ea"><div class="ea">There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases.
                
                The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may 
                not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the 
                relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information.
                
                The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key 
                destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.
                
                Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here. 
                
                When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing 
                wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible 
                but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements 
                garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.
                
                Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time 
                until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time 
                if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and 
                file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection 
                upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is 
                connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
                
                The drive should be healthy and contain minimal corrupted data and should be at end-of-life before a significant 
                amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of 
                potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.</div></div><div class="eacategory">Tests</div><div class="ea"><div class="ea">
